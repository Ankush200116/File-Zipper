**OVERVIEW**
File Zipper is a Python-based application that leverages Huffman coding for lossless data compression. This project aims to efficiently compress and decompress text data using a priority queue (min-heap) for constructing an optimal Huffman tree. The implementation includes a custom HuffmanNode class to represent nodes within the Huffman tree.

**Key Contributions:**
-> Developed a robust priority queue using Python's heapq module for streamlined node selection during Huffman tree construction.
-> Integrated a bottom-up greedy algorithm to build a Huffman tree, enhancing the efficiency of the encoding process.
-> Implemented both encoding and decoding functionalities, enabling effective compression and decompression of text data.
-> Demonstrated expertise in data structures and algorithms, ensuring the project's adherence to Huffman coding principles.

**Technologies Used:**
-> Python
-> Data Structures (Priority Queue, Tree)
-> Algorithms (Greedy Algorithm)
-> File Handling

**Outcome:**
The successfully completed File Zipper project exemplifies an efficient Huffman coding system, highlighting proficiency in algorithmic and programming skills. This experience deepened insights into compression techniques and their practical applications, solidifying expertise in data structures and algorithm design.
